Subject: One Day Leave Request

Respected Manager,

I am writing to request a one day leave on [Date] due to personal reasons. I have some urgent matters that require my attention and I will not be able to come to work on that day.

I have discussed my work responsibilities with my team members and ensured that all urgent tasks will be completed before my leave. I will also make sure to complete any pending tasks upon my return to the office.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I assure you that I will make up for the lost time. I have been an active and dedicated member of this team and have not taken any leaves in the recent past.

I would be grateful if my leave request is approved and I assure you that I will be back at work promptly the next day. In case of any urgent matters, I can be reached at [Your Contact Details].

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
